        This is new service aimed at gathering the most critical data and news relevant to Gas and Power trading 
        and generating updates to push to you as early as possible.

        We have some quite ambitious plans around the technologies we might leverage to get those alerts to you, 
        how the data maybe processed to add extra insight and how to visualise such information effectively.

        For now though we are simply relaying critical alerts to you via email, a medium we know still favoured by many traders.

Again this included in free tier, visit the subscription page to subscribe. <br/>  <br/> We are finding that each of the data sources provide different fields e.g. comments, description, notes, so a good deal of our work is to reconcile the different forms of the data to bring them into a single outage type, which you can see in the data source pages in this site or in the email alerts.
    </br></br>This standard form should make it easier to read these messages and in time to process via an API`,
