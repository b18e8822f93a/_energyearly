        There are a host of approaches that are being applied to develop trading strategies that can beat the market, from classic statistical regression and optimisation methods to modern machine learning and AI.

        Whether you need to update model inputs or make qualitative judgements, latency on this news can be critical.
        
        As well as our notification service we provided a relatively simple application to visualise outages published recently.

        Specifically an accurate dataset of the current availability and clear notifications when that availability changes.
        
        Changes in the format or endpoint of the underlying data source can occur quite frequently, with effective monitoring we are quickly alerted to such changes and through the adoption of modern software best practices and patterns we can quickly test and deploy required fixes.

        Next will be an API to retrieve our datasets and include them in your analysis an easy reliable source for your production availability curves.
    
        Beyond that we have some axis to scale the offering; geography, market, availability type, for example we have some enquires regarding data from asia to support LNG analysis.
        
        In the background we have a lab investigating ideas around outage profiling and outage extension likelihood.
